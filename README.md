# BookingAppCpp
Although resources are limited in this program, I tried to make a small booking application where the user is a client or admin. The client can view counties, hotels, reviews or add reviews or reservations. In the admin menu, he can add counties, hotels and see some statistics about prices or rooms. The price per room is calculated according to capacity, days of rental and whether or not customers can dine in.
